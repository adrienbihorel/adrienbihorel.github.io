known issues:
- hgrid-collapse creates an overlap of mscroll-groups that is unclickable
- on some occurrences, clicking of of caption scrolls it to top but doesn't close it
- the clickcheck on caption considers the article inside of it to be out of it
- in firefox, animated gifs lead to cpu overload
- in ie and edge the height of the menu items is 2rem instead of 1
- in android "internet" browser mscroll struggles
- mscroll sync of sliders manages to get off sync
- on devices with pixel ratio > 1, caption seems to miss 1px of width

to do:
- improve media queries
- insert text
	> do the quick comment exercise

ask for help:
- improve/streamline mscroll-items syncing
	> elegantly solve conflicts with clickCheck and viewportCheck
	> improve/streamline toggler
- improve/streamline the construction and insertion of icons
- review javascript structure/patterns
	> improve scopes? make more things private?
	try to pass properties to inner functions instead of entire parent to the constructor

ideas of improvements:
- disable gifs in firefox
- click out of the article inside of caption to close it
- improve/streamline mscroll-loop
	> make it work on ios: offset of a viewport length the ends of mscroll-area and the looping thresholds
	> keep scroll velocity on scroll spawn (works with mousewheel.js)
- make toggler take toggling time in account again
- implement partial load / total load with tiny images
	> change load image system for a per node system: doLoad($thisImage)
  so i can select different groups (and filter out images with specific indexes in image groups)
  basically make two groups: pre and post render of dynamic content
- re-implement position: absolute + transform: translate3d on mscroll-items
- have the html change on scroll pos / direct links for projects or posts
- have a splash page
- auto center mscroll-item in viewport (x and y)
- y auto center text in parent (while sticking to the baseline)
- re-implement isotope

completed:
- comment out some images
- transfer projects functions and properties over to mscroll-items
