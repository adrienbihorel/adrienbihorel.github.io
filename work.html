								« Over time, our senses have evolved to tune into the stimuli necessary for survival. How do these actions of survival inform our cultural or creative output?<br>
								The human body can be considered an instrument, our movements creating vibrations both within and beyond the limits of our senses. As we navigate through our environment, we tune into this stimuli. Constantly adapting - creating an evolving feedback loop between ourselves and surrounding space. 440Hz tunes into this field, utilising light and sound to translate energy into a form which we can see, hear and feel - enabling a physical and emotional response. The canvas surrounds the participant, continuously being re-sculpting and transformed in direct response to their actions. »<br><br>

								« During the 1st century B.C., mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras discovered a series of relationships between geometry and harmonics. He identified that the pitch of a musical note is in proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.<br>
								Musica Universalis is a spatial instrument that investigates the resonances from far away objects in our solar system. It comprises a series of kinetic, physical sculptures, each containing a spherical form and a mechanism driving a rotating light source and speaker. Light is cast through the space creating interventions and interactions with the architecture. Oscillations slowly drift in and out of harmony within each cell and across the series. Over time, white light shifts into its component frequencies of colour. »<br><br>
