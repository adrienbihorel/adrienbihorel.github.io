# Lightmaps consists in a series of experiments inspired by the phenomenon of counter-shading, a natural form of camouflage first identified by A. H. Thayer in the 1890s. It intended to show how the integration of lighting data in the coloration process of an object makes it possible to adjust its «&nbsp;presence&nbsp;» within a visual scene. The 3d graphics function of lightmapping, which allows for the isolated computation of the brigthness of a surface, was made the core of the technical process.<br>
