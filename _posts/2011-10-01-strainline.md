# Strainline is an indoor / outdoor furniture range, dedicated to businesses and communities. It uses the «&nbsp;structural graphics&nbsp;» principle we developed. We designed simple box-shaped furniture pieces, from folded metal sheets, and calculated their mechanical stress under using conditions. Perforation patterns were then mapped onto the results: less stimulated areas were highly pierced, while most stimulated ones remained fully solid.<br>
