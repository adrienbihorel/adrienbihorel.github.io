# S550 is a little piece of polyamide that is used to mark the length of an anchor chain. Counting works on the principle of the abacus: a yellow marker reads as 5m, and a red one as 50m. One does the sum of all of the visible markers' values to get the overall length of the chain at that point.<br>
