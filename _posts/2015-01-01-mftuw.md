# «&nbsp;Message from the Unseen World is a permanent work inspired by the ideas and legacy of Alan Turing, one of the founding fathers of modern computer science. It was commissioned by Future City for British Land’s Paddington Central in London, where Turing was born.
# The front face of the artwork comprises LED and perforated aluminium panels that display a hard-coded version of extracts from Turing’s groundbreaking ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’, visually represented as patterns based on Baudot code. Within the artwork’s software lives another text, a poem by the writer Nick Drake.
# The artwork itself is a continuously evolving machine; an ‘engine’ that uses basic principles of artificial intelligence to endlessly interpret Drake’s work. The result is a literal in memoriam for Turing, a dynamic artwork that gives viewers a sense of witnessing a machine trying write like a poet, whilst thinking like a machine.&nbsp;»<br>
