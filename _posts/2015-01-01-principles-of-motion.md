# «&nbsp;A temporary installation of phase paintings accompanied by an abstracted, shifting cinematic landscape, Principles of Motion is inspired by the phenomenon of persistence of vision and plays with the viewers’ perception of movement and depth. The works began with an investigation into forms of music notation, perception of motion and parallax. By varying the apparent motion of simple geometric elements, the kinetic paintings suggest landscapes in motion. The rotating discs give the viewer the sense of travelling past an abstracted vista of patterns and rhythms, replicating the effect of speed's ability to create an afterimage on the eye.&nbsp;»<br>
