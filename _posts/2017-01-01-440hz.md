# «&nbsp;Over time, our senses have evolved to tune into the stimuli necessary for survival. How do these actions of survival inform our cultural or creative output?
# The human body can be considered an instrument, our movements creating vibrations both within and beyond the limits of our senses. As we navigate through our environment, we tune into this stimuli. Constantly adapting - creating an evolving feedback loop between ourselves and surrounding space. 440Hz tunes into this field, utilising light and sound to translate energy into a form which we can see, hear and feel - enabling a physical and emotional response. The canvas surrounds the participant, continuously being re-sculpting and transformed in direct response to their actions.&nbsp;»<br>
