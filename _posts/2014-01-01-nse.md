# NSE is a series of performative sculptures that extends the experiments of Lightmaps. Combining print and laser cut, these sculptures were designed in such a way that they would encapsulate an infinite number of surface angles. This allowed for an equally infinite number of clues, all participating to the very same lie.<br>
