# «&nbsp;A Distant View is a series inspired by the first images captured by the original Lunar Orbiter missions in 1966-1967, prior to the Moon Landings. Their effect on the public was extremely visceral, due to the depiction of this landscape that had always been beyond our reach. This was the first time we could see the surface of the Moon as if we were there —Except that we weren’t. Images like these aren’t captured, but created; it’s a curious thing how we ‘see’ through deciphering the garbled data sent from space.
# A Distant View reconstructs the reality as captured in the original photographs of the lunar surface. Light reveals the ‘shadows’ of the data; the unseen landscapes in the photographs, hidden by technology and perspective. A Distant View turns these historical photographs into relief, bringing the unreachable within reach.&nbsp;»<br>
